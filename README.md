# Distributed Publisher-Subscriber System! ðŸ“¬

This Java-based project enables real-time communication between multiple publishers and subscribers using a network of Brokers to handle message routing with flexibility and efficiency.

## System Design
- **Decoupled Architecture** <br>
  The system decouples publishers and subscribers through a network of Brokers, allowing for asynchronous communication and reducing direct dependencies between components.
- **Multi-Broker Synchronization** <br>
  Brokers communicate with each other to ensure message consistency across the network, so subscribers can always receive relevant messages, regardless of which Broker they're connected to.
- **Fault Tolerance & Scalability** <br>
  Fault-tolerant mechanisms are in place to handle disconnections of publishers or subscribers, automatically removing related topics and subscriptions to maintain system consistency. Additionally, using a thread-per-client model ensures that each connection is handled independently, enhancing scalability.
- **TCP Socket Communication** <br>
  The system uses TCP sockets for reliable, connection-oriented communication between publishers, subscribers, and brokers. This design choice ensures that messages are reliably delivered and that real-time updates are consistently synchronized across all brokers.

## ðŸ“¤ Publisher Functionality
- **Create Topics**: Publishers can create new topics with unique identifiers, establishing channels for message distribution.
- **Publish Messages**: Once a topic is created, publishers can broadcast messages to subscribers through the broker, ensuring that all interested subscribers receive real-time updates.
- **Show Subscriber Count**: Publishers can check the number of subscribers for each topic to monitor engagement.
- **Delete Topics**: Publishers can delete topics, and the system will automatically notify and remove subscriptions for those topics.

## ðŸ“¥ Subscriber Functionality
- **List Topics**: Subscribers can view all available topics and choose which ones to subscribe to.
- **Subscribe to Topics**: Subscribers can subscribe to specific topics to receive all future messages posted to those topics.
- **Receive Real-Time Messages**: Subscribers receive messages in real time as they are published, with the broker handling message forwarding and delivery.
- **Unsubscribe from Topics**: Subscribers can choose to unsubscribe from topics and will receive a confirmation notification.


## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started
Make sure you have JDK 21.0.3 installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Download the following files and place them in a folder:
   - `broker.jar`
   - `publisher.jar`
   - `subscriber.jar`

2. Navigate to the folder in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/folder
   ```
3. Start the Broker by specifying the port:
   ```bash
   java -jar broker.jar <port>
   ```
4. Start the Publisher and connect it to a Broker:
   ```bash
   java -jar publisher.jar <broker-ip> <broker-port>
   ```
5. Start the Subscriber and connect it to a Broker:
   ```bash
   java -jar subscriber.jar <broker-ip> <broker-port>
   ```
